anything indeed but condemning', 'me to lie abed such an unendurable length of time.  but she was the', 'best and most conscientious of stepmothers, and back i had to go to', 'my room.  for several hours i lay there broad awake, feeling a great', 'deal worse than i have ever done since, even from the greatest', 'subsequent misfortunes.  at last i must have fallen into a troubled', 'nightmare of a doze;

and suddenly felt a slight scratch.  throwing aside the', \"counterpane, there lay the tomahawk sleeping by the savage's side, as\", 'if it were a hatchet-faced baby.  a pretty pickle, truly, thought i;', 'abed here in a strange house in the broad day, with a cannibal and a', 'tomahawk!  \"queequeg!--in the name of goodness, queequeg, wake!\"  at', 'length, by dint of much wriggling, and loud and incessant', 'expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow male', 'in that matrimonial sort of style, i succeeded in extracting a grunt;', 'and presently, he drew back his arm, shook himself all over like a', 'newfoundland dog just from the water, and sat up in bed, stiff as a', 'pike-staff, looking at me, and rubbing his eyes as if he did not', 'altogether remember how i came to be there, though a dim', 'consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning', 'over him.  meanwhile, i lay quietly eyeing him, having no serious', 'misgivings now, and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a', 'creature.  when, at last, his mind seemed made up touching the', 'character of his bedfellow, and he became, as it were, reconciled to', 'the fact;

staring at him', 'from the bed, and watching all his toilette motions; for the time my', 'curiosity getting the better of my breeding.  nevertheless, a man', \"like queequeg you don't see every day, he and his ways were well\", 'worth unusual regarding.', '', 'he commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a very tall', 'one, by the by, and then--still minus his trowsers--he hunted up his', 'boots.  what under the heavens he did it for, i cannot tell, but his', 'next movement was to crush himself--boots in hand, and hat on--under', 'the bed; when, from sundry violent gaspings and strainings, i', 'inferred he was hard at work booting himself; though by no law of', 'propriety that i ever heard of, is any man required to be private', 'when putting on his boots.  but queequeg, do you see, was a creature', 'in the transition stage--neither caterpillar nor butterfly.  he was', 'just enough civilized to show off his outlandishness in the strangest', 'possible manners.  his education was not yet completed.  he was an', 'undergraduate.  if he had not been a small degree civilized, he very', 'probably would not have troubled himself with boots at all;

i begged him as well as i could, to accelerate his toilet', 'somewhat, and particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as', 'possible.  he complied, and then proceeded to wash himself.  at that', 'time in the morning any christian would have washed his face; but', 'queequeg, to my amazement, contented himself with restricting his', 'ablutions to his chest, arms, and hands.  he then donned his', 'waistcoat, and taking up a piece of hard soap on the wash-stand', 'centre table, dipped it into water and commenced lathering his face.', 'i was watching to see where he kept his razor, when lo and behold, he', 'takes the harpoon from the bed corner, slips out the long wooden', 'stock, unsheathes the head, whets it a little on his boot, and', 'striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall, begins a vigorous', 'scraping, or rather harpooning of his cheeks.  thinks i, queequeg,', \"this is using rogers's best cutlery with a vengeance.  afterwards i\", 'wondered the less at this operation when i came to know of what fine', 'steel the head of a harpoon is made, and how exceedingly sharp the', 'long straight edges are always kept.', '', 'the rest of his toilet was soon achieved, and he proudly marched out', 'of the room, wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket, and', \"sporting his harpoon like a marshal's baton.\"]\n",
